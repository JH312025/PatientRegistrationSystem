A system is made up of 94.2% PHP Language and 5.8% CSS only.
The Primary purpose of the  system is to provide a set of features such as Patient Registration, the added patient will be saved to the created database using phpmyadmin as Auto Increment.
The encoded patient can be viewed by the user account by default shown in the patient list but don't have access to edit the information.
Only the admin account can edit and delete the patient information for the Data Privacy & Compliance.
In addition to the Advanced Search & Filtering, I only used a % function at the front and end of the "search" command to view the sounds LIKE first name or last name.
